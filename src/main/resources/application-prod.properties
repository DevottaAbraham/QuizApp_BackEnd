# --- Database Configuration ---
# These values should be set as environment variables in your hosting provider's dashboard.
spring.datasource.url=${DB_URL}
spring.datasource.username=${DB_USERNAME}
spring.datasource.password=${DB_PASSWORD}
FrontEnd_URl=${FrontEnd_URl}

# --- JPA/Hibernate Configuration ---
# 'validate' is safer for production. It checks if the schema matches the entities
# without trying to make changes. 'none' is also an option if you manage the schema entirely with Flyway.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate

# --- Security Configuration ---
# These secrets MUST be set as strong, random strings in your hosting environment.
jwt.secret=${JWT_SECRET}
application.security.admin-setup-token=${ADMIN_SETUP_TOKEN}

# --- Cookie Configuration ---
# This is CRITICAL for security. It ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
application.security.cookie.secure=true

# --- Logging Configuration ---
# Set the root logging level to INFO for production to reduce log noise.
